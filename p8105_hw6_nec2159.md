In homicide cases in Baltimore, MD, male victims had 0.4255117 times the
odds of having their cases solved compared to female victims after
adjusting for age and race. We are 95% confident that the true odds
ratio for male versus female victims is between 0.3241908 and 0.5575508.

``` r
all_city_results =
homicide_df |> 
  nest(data = -city_state) |> 
  mutate(
    fits = map(data, \(df) glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = df, family = binomial)),
    results = map(fits, \(x) broom::tidy(x, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE))
  ) |> 
  unnest(results) |> 
  select(city_state, term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")
```

    ## Warning: There were 45 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `results = map(fits, function(x) broom::tidy(x, conf.int = TRUE,
    ##   exponentiate = TRUE))`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred

After comparing all the cities, NYC is where male homicide victims had
the lowest odds of having their cases solved relative to female victims
after adjusting for age and race. Albuquerque is the city where male
homicide victims had the highest odds of having their cases solved
relative to female victims after adjusting for age and race.

## Problem 2

``` r
data("weather_df")

estimates =
weather_df |> 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 500) |> 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, \(df) lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = df)),
    tidy_results = map(models, broom::tidy),
    glance_results = map(models, broom::glance),
    beta_ratio = map_dbl(tidy_results, \(x) x[["estimate"]][2] / x[["estimate"]][3]),
    r_squared = map_dbl(glance_results, "r.squared")
    ) |> 
  select(.id, beta_ratio, r_squared)
```

``` r
estimates |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = beta_ratio)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "lavender", color = "purple") +
  labs(
    title = "Bootstrap Distribution of Beta Ratio"
  )
```

The distribution of $\frac{\hat{\beta}_1}{\hat{\beta}_2}$ appears to be
left-skewed. This means there is a larger cluster of ratios on the
higher end, indicating that in many bootstrap samples, ${\hat{\beta}_1}$
tends to be relatively large or ${\hat{\beta}_2}$ tends to be relatively
small compared to their typical values. Intuitively, it is probably more
likely that ${\hat{\beta}_2}$ is more variable than ${\hat{\beta}_1}$
since minimum and maximum temperature are most likely more correlated
than precipitation and maximum temperature.

``` r
estimates |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = r_squared)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "lavender", color = "purple") +
  labs(
    title = "Bootstrap Distribution of R Squared"
  )
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

<img src="p8105_hw6_nec2159_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

The distribution of $R^2$ appears to be normally distributed and
centered around 0.941. Most estimates are very close to this value,
indicating the proportion of variance explained by the model is high
across bootstrap samples.

``` r
beta_ratio_CI =
estimates |> 
  pull(beta_ratio) |> 
  quantile(c(.025, .975))
```

``` r
estimates |> 
  pull(r_squared) |> 
  quantile(c(.025, .975))
```
